## Project Overview
This project aims to classify inner speech using EEG data. The Thinking Out Loud dataset is used for this purpose. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, training machine learning models, and evaluating their performance.

## Dataset
The Thinking Out Loud dataset is used in this project. Please ensure you have the necessary permissions to access and use the dataset.

## Pipeline Description
1. Data Loading
The first step involves loading the Thinking Out Loud dataset. This dataset contains EEG recordings of inner speech activities.

2. Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning the EEG signals, handling missing values, and segmenting the data into appropriate windows for analysis.

3. Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is performed on the preprocessed EEG signals to derive relevant features that can be used for classification.

4. Model Training
Various machine learning models are trained on the extracted features. This includes setting up the model architecture, defining the loss function, and optimizing the model parameters.

5. Evaluation
The trained models are evaluated on a test set to assess their performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used for evaluation.

## Results
The results of the model training and evaluation are presented, highlighting the performance of different models and any significant findings.
